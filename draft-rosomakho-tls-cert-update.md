--- abstract

This document defines a mechanism that enables TLS 1.3 endpoints to update their certificates during the lifetime of a connection using Exported Authenticators. A new extension is introduced to negotiate support for certificate update at handshake time. When negotiated, either endpoint can provide a post-handshake authenticator containing an updated certificate, delivered via a new handshake message. This mechanism allows long-lived TLS connections to remain valid across certificate rotations without requiring session termination.

# Introduction

{{!TLS=RFC8446}} provides strong guarantees of confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, but does not include a general-purpose mechanism for updating certificates of both endpoints after the handshake. While TLS 1.3 permits post-handshake authentication for clients as defined in {{Section 4.6.2 of TLS}}, it provides no standardized way for servers to update their certificates once the handshake is complete. Additionally, TLS 1.3 post-handshake authentication is explicitly prohibited from QUIC according to {{Section 4.4 of ?QUIC-TLS=RFC9001}} and HTTP/2 according to {{Section 2 of ?HTTP2-TLS13=RFC8740}} because it allows clients to introduce new certificates and change authorization properties of the connection.

This presents a limitation for long-lived connections in environments where certificates may need to be refreshed, whether due to expiration, revocation, or key rotation. Terminating and re-establishing connections solely for the purpose of updating certificates can be disruptive and inefficient.

Exported Authenticators {{!EXPORTED-AUTH=RFC9261}} offer a general-purpose mechanism for proving possession of a certificate after the handshake, using an authenticator request supplied by the peer. However, the specification does not define a mechanism for transmitting authenticator requests or delivering authenticators at the TLS layer.

This document defines a mechanism for certificate updates within an established TLS 1.3 connection. It introduces a new extension, `certificate_update_request`, that allows each endpoint to optionally include an authenticator request as part of the initial handshake. This request can later be used by the peer to generate an Exported Authenticator containing an update certificate.

To deliver the updated certificate, a new TLS handshake message, `CertificateUpdate`, is defined. This message carries a complete Exported Authenticator and may be sent by either endpoint after the handshake, as long as an authenticator request was previously provided by the peer.

Because authenticator requests are single-use and may not be reused in subsequent authenticator constructions, a second post-handshake message is defined: `CertificateUpdateRequest`. This message allows an endpoint to provide a new authenticator request for future use after processing a `CertificateUpdate`.

This approach allows TLS connections to remain valid across certificate updates without requiring session termination. It is compatible with TLS 1.3 and {{?QUIC=RFC9000}}, and can be used regardless of the application protocol encapsulated within the connection.

The certificate update mechanism in the document is deliberately constrained to preserve the authentication and authorization context of the connection. The updated certificate must retain the same subject, attributes, and issuing certificate authority as the original, with the only permitted difference being the validity period. This ensures that the peer identity remains unchanged and that application-layer authorization decisions based on the original certificate continue to hold after the update. By limiting the scope of updates in this way, the mechanism provides secure and seamless certificate refresh without altering the security properties of the TLS session.

## Certificate Update flow

Diagram below illustrates the certificate update process:

{: #fig-server-cert-update title="Certificate Update Process"}

TLS peers negotiate support of the Certificate Update mechanism by including `certificate_update_request` extension in the `ClientHello` and `EncryptedExtensions` messages. As explained in {{initial-authenticator-request}}, the extention MAY contain an Authenticator Request can later be used by the peer to provide an updated certificate.

During the lifetime of the TLS session, either peer MAY provide updated certificate by sending a `CertificateUpdate` message containing an Authenticator, as defined in {{cert-update-message}}. After successfully validating the updated certificate, the receiving peer MAY provide a new Authenticator Request using the `CertificateUpdateRequest` message defined in {{additional-authenticator-requests}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Negotiating Support and Providing Initial Authenticator Request {#initial-authenticator-request}

To enable certificate updates, endpoints must explicitly indicate support during the TLS 1.3 handshake. This is done using the `certificate_update_request` extension, which may be included in either the ClientHello or EncryptedExtensions message.

The presence of this extension indicates that the sender supports the certificate update mechanism defined in this document. Optionally, the extension MAY carry an authenticator request. If present, this request can be used by the peer to construct an exported authenticator for delivery in a `CertificateUpdate` handshake message.

The extension MAY also be included with an empty "extension_data" field, which indicates support for the mechanism without offering an authenticator request.

## The certificate_update_request Extension

The `certificate_update_request` extension is used to negotiate support for post-handshake certificate updates. It MAY appear in the `ClientHello` and in the `EncryptedExtensions` message.

The extension MUST NOT appear more than once from the same endpoint during a handshake. If it appears multiple times or in an unexpected message, the receiving peer MUST abort the handshake with an `illegal_parameter` alert.

- When sent in a `ClientHello`, the "extension_data" field, MUST be empty or contain a `CertificateRequest` structure as defined in {{Section 4 of EXPORTED-AUTH}}.
- When sent in `EncryptedExtensions`, the "extension_data" field, MUST be empty or contain a `ClientCertificateRequest` structure, also defined in {{Section 4 of EXPORTED-AUTH}}.

If "extension_data" field is not empty, it is encoded as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~ ascii-art
struct {
    select (Handshake.msg_type) {
        case client_hello:         CertificateRequest;
        case encrypted_extensions: ClientCertificateRequest;
    }
} CertificateUpdateRequestExtension;
~~~~~~~~~~
{: title="Optional extension_data of certificate_update_request extension"}

The semantics of the extension are as follows:

- If the extension is omitted, the sender indicates that it does not support receiving or sending certificate updates.
- If the extension is present with a zero-length extension_data, the sender indicates that it does not wish to receive certificate updates, but may provide a `CertificateUpdate` message later in the session if the peer supplied an authenticator request.
- If the extension is present with a non-empty "extension_data" field, the sender indicates support for certificate updates and provides an authenticator request that the peer may use to generate an exported authenticator in `CertificateUpdate` message. The `extensions` list inside the authenticator request MUST be empty.

## Handling Malformed Extension Data

If an endpoint receives a `certificate_update_request` extension with a non-empty "extension_data" field that cannot be parsed as a valid `CertificateRequest` (when received in `ClientHello`) or `ClientCertificateRequest` (when received in `EncryptedExtensions`) with empty authenticator request `extensions`, it MUST abort the handshake with an `illegal_parameter` alert.

Endpoints MUST NOT attempt to interpret or store a malformed authenticator request. The extension is either valid and usable or invalid and fatal to the handshake.

# Certificate Update {#cert-update-message}

Once the the handshake has completed and a peer has provided an authenticator request the other endpoint may send a certificate update using the `CertificateUpdate` handshake message.

The `CertificateUpdate` message carries a single Exported Authenticator, constructed using the previously received authenticator request. Authenticator requests are single-use and MUST NOT be reused for multiple updates.

The message is structured as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~ ascii-art
struct {
    opaque authenticator<1..2^24-1>;
} CertificateUpdate;
~~~~~~~~~~
{: title="CertificateUpdate message"}

Embedded authenticator is defined in {{Section 5.2.4 of EXPORTED-AUTH}} as a concantenation of serialized Certificate, CertificateVerify and Finished messages.

## Requirements for Authenticators {#authenticators-requirements}

The Exported Authenticator carried in a `CertificateUpdate` message MUST meet the following requirements:

- The subject field of the certificate MUST match exactly with the certificate originally presented by the sender during the handshake.
- All extensions present in the original certificate MUST also be present in the updated certificate with identical values.
- Updated certificate MUST NOT contain any extensions that are not present in the original certificate.
- The public key MAY differ from the original, but the public key algorithm and key length MUST match those of the original certificate.
- The issuer of the updated certificate MUST be the same as the issuer of the original certificate.
- The `SignatureScheme` used in the `CertificateVerify` message of the Exported Authenticator MUST be the same as the one used in the sender’s original handshake authentication.
- The certificate provided in the `CertificateUpdate` message MUST NOT have been used previously by the sender during the current TLS session.

These constraints ensure that the authenticator represents the same logical identity and cryptographic profile as the original authentication, while ensuring freshness and preventing redundant certificate reuse. A peer that receives a `CertificateUpdate` containing a certificate or signature that does not meet these requirements MUST terminate the connection with an `illegal_parameter` alert.

## Sending and Receiving Certificate Updates

A `CertificateUpdate` message MAY be sent by either endpoint only after the handshake has completed, specifically after the sender has sent and received the `Finished` message. The message MUST NOT be sent during the handshake or before the authentication block is complete.

A `CertificateUpdate` message MUST NOT be sent unless a valid authenticator request has been received from the peer and has not yet been used. Each authenticator request is single-use and MUST NOT be reused across multiple updates.

In addition, a client MUST NOT send a `CertificateUpdate` unless it previously authenticated with a certificate during the handshake or via TLS 1.3 post-handshake authentication {{Section 4.6.2 of TLS}}.

If any of the above conditions are violated, the recipient MUST terminate the connection with an `unexpected_message` alert.

The message carries a single Exported Authenticator, as defined in {{Section 5.2.4 of EXPORTED-AUTH}}, in the authenticator field. If the authenticator is empty (i.e., it does not contain a `Certificate`), the peer MUST terminate the connection with an `illegal_parameter` alert.

Upon receiving a valid `CertificateUpdate`, the peer MUST validate the Exported Authenticator according to {{EXPORTED-AUTH}} and {{authenticators-requirements}} of this document. If validation fails, the connection MUST be aborted with an `illegal_parameter` alert.

Only one certificate update is permitted per authenticator request. Additional update MUST be provided only in response to a `CertificateUpdateRequest` message as described in {{additional-authenticator-requests}}.

# Additional Authenticator Requests {#additional-authenticator-requests}

Each authenticator request is intended for one-time use, meaning that after an endpoint uses it to generate a `CertificateUpdate`, it cannot be reused for additional updates. To allow for subsequent certificate updates over the lifetime of a TLS connection, this document defines a new handshake message: `CertificateUpdateRequest`.

The `CertificateUpdateRequest` message allows an endpoint to send a fresh authenticator request to the peer after a previous `CertificateUpdate` has been successfully processed.

The message is structured as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~ ascii-art
struct {
    opaque authenticator_request<1..2^16-1>;
} CertificateUpdateRequest;
~~~~~~~~~~
{: title="CertificateUpdateRequest message"}

The authenticator_request field MUST contain either a `CertificateRequest` or a `ClientCertificateRequest`, depending on the role of the sender and the direction of certificate update expected:

- A client sends a `CertificateRequest` structure (to refresh the server’s certificate).
- A server sends a `ClientCertificateRequest` structure (to refresh the client’s certificate).

The structure and encoding of these fields are identical to the formats defined in {{Section 4 of EXPORTED-AUTH}}. The `extensions` of the authenticator request MUST be empty.

## Sending and Receiving CertificateUpdateRequest

A `CertificateUpdateRequest` message MAY be sent at any time after processing a valid `CertificateUpdate` from the peer. An endpoint MUST NOT send a `CertificateUpdateRequest` unless it has received and verified a `CertificateUpdate` using the previous authenticator request. The endpoint MUST wait for the peer to complete a `CertificateUpdate` using the outstanding request before sending a new one.

Upon receiving a `CertificateUpdateRequest`, the peer MUST validate that the message contains a well-formed `CertificateRequest` or `ClientCertificateRequest`, depending on the sender’s role. If the message is malformed, the authenticator request cannot be parsed or the authenticator request contains extensions, the connection MUST be terminated with an `illegal_parameter` alert.

# Applicability to QUIC

This specification is applicable to the {{QUIC}} protocol, which uses TLS 1.3 for connection security as described in {{?QUIC-TLS=RFC9001}}.

Endpoints implementing this specification over QUIC MUST encapsulate `CertificateUpdate` and `CertificateUpdateRequest` handshake messages within CRYPTO frames, consistent with the general treatment of TLS messages in QUIC.

All other requirements defined in this document, including handshake process, message sequences, validation procedures, and error handling, apply equally to QUIC deployments. A QUIC connection MUST treat protocol violations (such as sending a `CertificateUpdate` before the handshake completes) as connection errors of type `CRYPTO_ERROR`, using an appropriate alert code such as `illegal_parameter` or `unexpected_message` mapped as defined in {{Section 20.1 of QUIC}}.

The certificate update mechanism defined in this document is compatible with QUIC as it does not introduce changes to the peer's identity.

# Applicability to DTLS

This specification is also applicable to DTLS 1.3 {{!DTLS=RFC9147}}. The `CertificateUpdate` and `CertificateUpdateRequest` messages are handshake messages and are subject to DTLS built-in support for sequencing, fragmentation, retransmission, and replay detection, as specified in {{DTLS}}. No additional protection mechanisms are required beyond the normal DTLS handshake processing.

# Security Considerations

This mechanism relies on the security properties of {{TLS}} and Exported Authenticators {{EXPORTED-AUTH}}. It introduces additional opportunities for certificate-based authentication after the initial handshake and requires careful handling to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.

## Identity Continuity

The requirements on updated certificates and signature algorithms ensure that the logical identity authenticated during the handshake remains consistent after a certificate refresh. Endpoints MUST enforce the constraints described in {{authenticators-requirements}} to prevent identity swapping or privilege escalation.

Updated certificates MUST NOT introduce new names, extensions, or capabilities beyond those present in the original certificate. Failure to enforce these constraints could allow an attacker to impersonate a different entity within the same connection.

## Replay Prevention

Each authenticator request MUST be used exactly once to prevent replay attacks. Exported Authenticators inherently bind to the session and context, but replaying an old `CertificateUpdate` against a reused authenticator request could allow undetected identity reuse.

Endpoints MUST discard authenticator requests after a successful `CertificateUpdate` and MUST validate that each certificate update corresponds uniquely to the most recent authenticator request received.

## Application-Layer Implications

Applications that rely on peer certificate properties for access control decisions MAY reevaluate those decisions after a certificate update if needed. However, because the updated certificate is required to maintain the same identity, such re-validation is typically unnecessary for applications that rely only on the peer's authenticated identity. If the updated certificate does not match the identity validated during the TLS handshake, the TLS stack MUST terminate the connection.
